- `Start.cs` - Player spawn point marker
- `Finish.cs` - Level exit with completion conditions
- `Stat.cs` - Stat boost system for equipment
- `Skill.cs` - Player skill system [MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION]

**Interfaces:**
- `ITrap.cs` - Interface for trap mechanics

#### C. MapEditor (Level Editor - Windows Only)
**Location:** `/MapEditor/`
**Purpose:** GUI tool for creating and editing game levels
**Note:** Requires Windows Forms, not functional in Linux environment

**Files:**
- `Editor.cs` - Main editor window with maze editing capabilities
- `Program.cs` - Editor application entry point
- `EditForms/` - Specialized editing forms for different object types
  * `ItemEditForm.cs` - Item property editor
  * `EquipmentEditForm.cs` - Equipment property editor  
  * `FinishEditForm.cs` - Level completion condition editor

#### D. MapGenerator (Utility)
**Location:** `/MapGenerator/`
**Purpose:** Procedural maze generation tool

**Files:**
- `Program.cs` - Console application for generating maze files
- `Maze.cs` - Maze generation algorithms

## GAME MECHANICS

### Core Systems:
1. **Movement System** - Arrow key navigation through maze
2. **Inventory System** - Item collection and management (I key)
3. **Interaction System** - Object examination (O key) and pickup (P key)
4. **Save/Load System** - Game state persistence (F5 to save)
5. **Level System** - Progressive maze levels with completion conditions

### Player Actions:
- **Arrow Keys** - Move through maze
- **O** - Observe/Look around current location
- **P** - Pick up items at current location  
- **U** - Use/Interact with adjacent objects
- **I** - Open inventory menu
- **F5** - Save current game state

### Object Types (ObjectTypeEnum):
- PC (0) - Player Character
- NPC (1) - Non-Player Characters
- Door (2) - Interactive barriers
- Trap (3) - Hidden teleports/damage
- Item (4) - Collectible objects
- Start (5) - Level spawn point
- Finish (6) - Level exit

### Item Types (ItemTypeEnum):
- Key - Opens locked doors
- Equipment - Provides stat bonuses when equipped
- Consumable - Single-use items (potions)
- Treasure - Required for level completion

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ WORKING FEATURES:
- Maze navigation and rendering
- Inventory management
- Item pickup and examination
- Equipment system with stat bonuses
- Save game functionality
- Trap system (teleportation)
- Combat mechanics (basic)
- Audio support (background music)

### ‚ùå MISSING/INCOMPLETE FEATURES:
- **NPC Interaction System** - No way to talk to NPCs in main game loop
- **Dialogue Integration** - Dialogue system exists but not connected
- **Quest System** - No quest tracking or completion mechanics
- **LoadGame() Implementation** - Method throws NotImplementedException
- **Advanced Combat** - Limited enemy encounters
- **Skill System** - Minimal implementation

### üîß AREAS NEEDING IMPROVEMENT:
- NPC placement in levels for testing
- Interactive dialogue in main game loop
- Quest objectives and tracking
- Better error handling and input validation
- Code documentation and comments

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Dependencies:
- .NET 8.0
- Newtonsoft.Json (JSON serialization)
- NetCoreAudio (sound/music playback)

### File Formats:
- **.map files** - Plain text maze layout (1=passable, 0=wall)
- **.state files** - JSON serialized game objects
- **save.zip** - Compressed game save containing map, objects, and player state

### Architecture Pattern:
- Model-View separation (MapModel for logic, Maze for presentation)
- Object-oriented design with inheritance hierarchy
- Event-driven dialogue system with Action delegates
- Factory pattern for object creation during deserialization

## DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

### Immediate Priorities:
1. Add NPC interaction key ('T' for Talk) to main game loop
2. Implement LoadGame() functionality
3. Create example quest linking Clarisa and Owen NPCs
4. Add NPCs to first level for testing

### Future Enhancements:
- Extended quest system with objective tracking
- More diverse enemy types and combat scenarios
- Improved UI with status displays
- Sound effects for actions
- Configuration system for game settings
